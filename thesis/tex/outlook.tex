In the near future this report is meant to accompany by a more complex guide for the rs/6000 back-end that deals with extending the back-end for the PPU. Then the purpose of this guide will be more clear as new intrinsic functions will be added to the back-end and there could be the need for even more complex intrinsics in the future as well. Then the AltiVec keyword simply needs to be replaced by the PPU's keyword.
