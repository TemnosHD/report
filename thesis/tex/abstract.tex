As part of the human brain project BrainScaleS is a unique project on many levels. This includes a processor solely used by the HICANN DLS, which manages synaptic weights for every neuron built into one of the many wafers. To accelerate the speed at which this so called plasticity processor unit (PPU) computes all synaptic weights of every neuron used, the processor has an extended instruction set architecture (ISA) that supports vector registers and single input multiple data (SIMD).
This report deals with the task of adding built-in functions to an existing backend of GCC, specifically the one used by the PPU, in order to extend the already implemented set of functions according to the users needs
