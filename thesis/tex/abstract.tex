As the BrainScaleS project has many facettes and also incorporates a custom processor in the HICANN-DLS that handles the synaptic weights of neurons on a wafer, hence its name Plasticity Processor Unit (PPU). Because of the custom nature of the PPU it is not fully supported by any compiler and current users have to handle register allocation and memory structures on a standard basis which is uncommon for users mainly familiar with front-end langugaes. Therefore it is planned to extend the GCC back-end to support the PPU. the main part of this is the expansion with custom built-in functions, that any front-end is meant to support. These built-in functions then allow for a more comfortable use of directives that still enable the user to trigger certain actions in the PPU.
