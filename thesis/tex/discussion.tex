It is obvious that this report does not help a lot in understanding how a compiler back-end completely works but rather is a tutorial on how to add intrinsic functions to the rs/6000 back-end. And even then it did not show all possibilities there are because most of them are barely needed and it would require further knowledge of a back-end. Therefore this guide should help the most when someone adds an insn to a back-end that should be part of the intrinsic function set. This is why I highly recommend looking into the GCC internals for further information on the back-ends in GCC.\todo{add link}
