\label{chapter:nameing conventions}
After we fully implemented our builtin functions we will finalize the functions by defining their final names. There are two naming conventions we can follow and typically it is advised to follow both in order to offer the user a set of alternatives. The first naming convention is the nameing convention already used by the AltiVec extension which starts every builtin function with vec\_ and chooses a general descriptive name which is derived from the used Assembly macro if possible.
This is the most intresting case for our exemplary Altivec builtin function. because there is already a vec\_ mul builltin we will choose the descriptive abbreviation vec\_ smul for scalar multiplication.
The other naming convention gets intresting when extending the backend with another vector extension. If there were an S2PP vector extension, all assembly macros would begin with fxv which is a good alternative for the vec\_ prefix altivec uses for its builtins. then it is a good idea so offer all assembly macros with their already known names e.g. fxvaddbm would become fxv\_ addbm. for more genral builtins that combine the halfword and byte macro it is recommended to leave out the letter h or b likewise. rendering fxv\_ addm the builtin function that works with both V8HI and V16QI vectors.
